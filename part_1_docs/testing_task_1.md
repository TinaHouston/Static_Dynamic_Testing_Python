### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:

# Should be double = on line 23.
# There should be a : after else on line 25.

  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   
# Dif is mispelled, should be def.
# There should be a comma after card1.
# Line 34 should be indented following the function name.
# Line 34 should be "card1" instead of "card".

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  
# It should be total = 0 in line 43.
# Return line (line 46) should be out of the loop inline with the for.

def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
